# We're going to use a CSV file from that bucket in our app. The file is here: https://uni-lab-files.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dabw/fruit_macros.txt

# We'll ask our app to put the list of selected fruits into a variable called fruits_selected. 
# Then, we'll ask our app to use the fruits in our fruits_selected list to pull rows from the full data set (and assign that data to a variable called fruits_to_show). 
# Finally, we'll ask the app to use the data in fruits_to_show in the dataframe it displays on the page.
